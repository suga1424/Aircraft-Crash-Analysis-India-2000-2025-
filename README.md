📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes **aircraft crash data across India from 2000 to 2025**, using **Power BI** to explore factors that lead to fatal outcomes.
The goal is to identify:

* 🧩 Patterns across operators, aircraft, and time

* ⚠️ High-risk crash conditions (like terrain, phase of flight)

* 📍 Geographical hotspots

* 🛠️ Root factors like technical faults, weather, and human error


📌 Key Insights

| Category                | Data Point                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🧍 Total Occupants      | **1,061**                          |
| ☠️ Total Fatalities     | **619**                            |
| ✅ Total Survivors       | **483**                            |
| 🤕 Total Injuries       | **80**                             |
| 🎯 Worst Operator       | **Air India Express (458 deaths)** |
| 🛫 Worst Aircraft Model | **Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (279)**  |
| 📍 Highest Risk Region  | **West India (307 fatalities)**    |
| 🕐 Risky Crash Time     | **Afternoon (329 deaths)**         |
| 🔧 Deadliest Cause      | **Technical Issues (284 deaths)**  |


🧠 What Can Be Improved

Based on the trends, here are **data-backed safety suggestions**:

🧑‍✈️ **Better pilot training** for takeoff and landing — key moments for human error
🧪 **Age-related checks** — aircraft older than 20 years show higher fatality rates
🌩️ **Weather AI integration** — optimize routing based on real-time forecasts
📡 **ATC coordination drills** — especially in Gujarat and coastal areas

🛠️ Tools & Tech

* 📌 **Power BI** (Dashboard design, DAX, visuals)
* 📑 **Manual Data Entry** — curated for every record
* ✅ **Double Validation** — from ASN, BAAA, Wikipedia, news sources, and final crash reports

📚 Data Sourcing & Validation

Data was **not scraped or downloaded** — every record was:

1. **Manually entered**
2. **Cross-checked with multiple sources**:

   * [Aviation Safety Network (ASN)](w)
   * [BAAA](w)
   * [Wikipedia](w)
   * Final investigation reports
   * Verified news reports (TOI, Hindu, BBC, etc.)

3.⚠️ Note: Some crashes are still under investigation or have limited public data.

   **As a result, certain numbers (fatalities, causes, etc.) may vary slightly based on evolving reports and source availability.**

🚀 Why This Project Matters

💡 This project doesn’t just showcase **Power BI skills** — it tells a real story.
A story that could:

* Influence aviation policy
* Assist in training programs
* Show how **data analysts can drive life-saving insights**

🙌 Author Note
“Every number here is a life. I didn’t just build this project — I respected it.”
Built by hand. Verified with care. Designed with purpose.
